title: Currently Reading Many Books!
---

I've been reading these books about the dark side of humanity, about the causes of crimes, psychopathy, narcissism etc. It has been a bit scary too. Because pretty much everybody has some of these traits, including myself. At least only a small minority have enough of these traits to be diagnosed as having a personality disorder, that's a relief. 

But even if you were born to be bad, you can always thrive to be good! And even if you were born to the good person, certain unfortunate life events can turn you to the dark side. Life is complex.
