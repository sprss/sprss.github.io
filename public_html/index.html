<h1>About me</h1>
 
 <h2> As a person </h2>
 <p>My name is Miika Pihkala.</p>
 <p>Autotelic person. An autotelic person needs few material possessions and little entertainment, comfort, power, or fame because so much of what he or she does is already rewarding. Because such persons experience flow in work, in family life, when interacting with people, when eating, even when alone with nothing to do, they depend less on external rewards that keep others motivated to go on with a life of routines. They are more autonomous and independent because they cannot be as easily manipulated with threats or rewards from the outside. At the same time, they are more involved with everything around them because they are fully immersed in the current of life.</p>
 <p>Multitalented. Resilient and stubborn. Passion driven, high fluctuations between being lazy and hardworking. </p>
 <p>Very open and agreeable personality. Not neurotic. Average conscientiousness. A bit more extrovert than introvert.</p>
 <p>I always tend to understand others and not judge them. I don't judge you for having different kind of brains and views than me, it's just how things are in life! </p>
 <p>Lack of narcisstic traits other than very high feelings of superiority and self-sufficiency. I actually don't feel like I'm better than most, although I know that I'm better than most in many things. I just think that I've got a lot of good performances from very early on and it has provided me with a great self-confidence. But I also occassionally screw things up miserably and hope to learn something when that happens.</p>
 <p>Lack of psychopathic traits. </p>
 <p>Social person, but also has hermit tendencies, because of being as much a dreamer as a man can be. So I'm happy with others and on my own, it's a win-win situation! :)</p>
 <p>High urge to walk my own road in life and create new and worthy things. </p>

   <h2> As a game designer </h2>
   <p> I'm into systemic games. I'm into elegancy and emergent properties. Here's a link to understand better <a href="https://onlinealchemy.wordpress.com/2015/05/18/systems-game-systems-and-systemic-games/"> what it means. </a>
 
  <h2> As a friend</h2>
  <p> I have a lot of good qualities for a great friend, but I'm pretty bad at contacting my friends, because of being this very autotelic and self-sufficient person. 
But I do enjoy most the time spent with other people. </p>
 
 <h2> As a lover</h2>
 <p> This gets quite private now, I'm not really saying anything, but I'll leave this youtube video here. </p>

  <h2> Questions & Answers </h2>
  
    <p> What are your favourite game design books? </p>
   <p> - My favourite game design book is Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences [Tynan Sylvester].
My second most favourite game design book is The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses[Jesse Schell]. </p>

 <p> What do you not like that almost everybody likes (in Finland)? </p>
 <p> - I don't like to see people I don't know naked or that people I don't know see me naked. I don't enjoy either attention in the internet,
or getting popular and followers, but I've understood now how important it is for my gaming career that I get the press attention. It would be useful to have big name 
in many industries, including games. But I'm very private person in this sense, although very open in most other ways. </p>
  <p> </p>
  
<p> Do you have irrational fears?</p>
<p> - Yes, I've got a fear of heights, but it has got better since I visited Sicily, which is really mountainous. So facing the fear has helped me.</p>
 
 <p> Some things that you like?</p>
 <p> - Improvisational theatre, standup comedy, movies, games, escape rooms, writing, philosophy, psychology.. ice cream.</p>

        <h2 id="tokakpl">About this game</h2>
<h2>Design</h2>
                  <p> If you decide to combine your pieces, then you get a stronger piece but at the same time you lose time from developing your position. If your opponent can constantly threat your more powerful pieces, then this can also be a drawback similar to the beginner mistake of developing queen first. Having less pieces can prove to be also a drawback when fighting over a critical square as then you can't pile up as many attacks to it. This all makes Super X Chess well-balanced, more dynamic and exciting chess game. With it's elegant and balanced design, it respects the original game of chess, but simultaneously makes the game feel fresh and renewed.
		   </p>

<h2><b>Rules</b></h2>
<ul id="sisallysluettelo">
	<li>Move your own piece to the same square as your another piece to create a combined, more powerful piece. </li>
	<li>When 2 pieces are merged, the piece can't be unmerged or merge again.</li>
	<li>Royal pieces (Queen and King) don't merge.</li>
	<li>Pawns promote on last rank only if they are not merged or the pawn is merged with another pawn.</li>
	<li>Slightly modified pawn promotion rules: Pawn+Pawn pieces promote to more powerful pieces, but regular Pawns now only promote to either Rook, Bishop or Knight.</li>
<li>Piece movement logics that are non-trivial are well thought out and include piece combinations of Knight+Knight, Rook+Rook and Pawn+Pawn.</li>

	</ul>
